my compiler depends on
    * haskell (ghc >= 6.12.1)
    * happy
    * python 2.6 and greater (but not 3.0)
    * bash

project is built with a makefile

make check can be used to run some tests if assmule is in the root of the
project (the directory that contains this readme!)

all files in "scripts/" need to be executable in order for make check
to function

binaries are in "build/"
* lexerbin is the lexer
* parserbin is the parser
* semanticsbin does semantic analysis
* compiler is the acutal compiler
* optimizing_compiler is an optimizing version of the compiler -- tests verify that this is idempotent

all binaries take two arguments, an input file an an output file
